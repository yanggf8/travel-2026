# Skill: /p5-itinerary (Legacy Spec Placeholder)

This file is intentionally minimal.

When we implement P5 in full, this will capture:
- canonical day/session schema
- pace rules (arrival/departure constraints)
- must-do prioritization + optional pools
- validation rules (time windows, transit time buffers)
- selection/confirmation workflow and status transitions
